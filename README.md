# MPT Usage Reporting Extension

`mpt-usage-reporting-extension` is a minimal SoftwareOne Marketplace extension built on top of `mpt-extension-sdk` and `mpt-tool`.

It is primarily a playground repository: it shows the baseline extension shape, a simple validation API endpoint, an event listener, a small fulfillment pipeline, and the development workflow used by extension repositories in this ecosystem.

## Repository Layout

- `backend/mpt_usage_reporting_extension/` contains the extension package.
- `backend/tests/` contains the pytest suite.
- `make/*.mk` contains the repository make targets.
- `compose.yaml` defines the local Docker-based development environment.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Docker with the `docker compose` plugin
- `make`

Recommended setup:

```bash
make build
make test
make run
```

The application runs on `http://localhost:8080`.
